## 🌟 What I Do

### 🔹 Java & Spring Boot
I build scalable, high-performance backend systems using **Java** and **Spring Boot**. From RESTful APIs to microservices, I’ve developed secure and efficient applications for various use cases.

- **Notable Projects**:
  - **E-Commerce Platform**: Built a full-featured e-commerce backend with Spring Boot, including user authentication, product catalog, and payment integration.
  - **Task Management API**: Created a REST API for task management with JWT-based authentication and MySQL database integration.

### 🔹 Python & Data Science
I leverage **Python** for data analysis, machine learning, and automation. My data science toolkit includes **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Matplotlib** for extracting insights from complex datasets.

- **Notable Projects**:
  - **Customer Churn Prediction**: Developed a machine learning model using Scikit-learn to predict customer churn with 85% accuracy.
  - **Data Visualization Dashboard**: Built an interactive dashboard using Plotly and Dash to visualize sales data trends.

### 🔹 R for Statistical Analysis
I use **R** for statistical analysis and data visualization, particularly in research-oriented projects where advanced statistical methods are required.

- **Notable Projects**:
  - **Healthcare Data Analysis**: Analyzed patient data using R to identify trends in disease prevalence, using ggplot2 for visualizations.
  - **Time Series Forecasting**: Performed time series analysis on financial data to forecast stock prices.

### 🔹 Docker
I containerize applications with **Docker** to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments. I also use Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications.

- **Notable Projects**:
  - **Microservices Deployment**: Deployed a Spring Boot microservices architecture using Docker containers, reducing deployment time by 40%.
  - **Data Science Environment**: Created a reproducible data science environment with Docker, bundling Python, R, and Jupyter Notebook.

### 🔹 Git & Version Control
I’m proficient with **Git** for version control, collaborating on projects, and managing repositories on GitHub. I use branching strategies like Git Flow to streamline development workflows.

- **Notable Contributions**:
  - Managing repositories with multiple contributors, ensuring clean commits and pull requests.
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

### 🔹 Web Development
I build responsive and dynamic web applications using modern technologies. While my backend expertise lies in Java and Spring Boot, I also work with frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Notable Projects**:
  - **Portfolio Website**: Developed a personal portfolio website with a Spring Boot backend and a React frontend.
  - **Blog Platform**: Created a blog platform with user authentication, post creation, and commenting features.
